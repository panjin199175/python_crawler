Chemical Bus
作曲 : 逃跑计划
 作词 : 逃跑计划


 Life repeats again and again
 Just like spinning wheels
 And its like everyday for the morning bus
 As I almost fall asleep you coming and sitting by me
 The electricity goes through
 My body it wants to shout
 What a strange world to make me feel so crazy
 What a strange love to make me feel so real
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away

 Work repeats again and again
 Just like broken dream
 And its going every way but the one I want
 What a strange world to make me feel so crazy
 What a strange love to make me feel so real
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away

 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 This is love just like chemical
 I had a dream and I make it beautiful
 And you now take my breath away
