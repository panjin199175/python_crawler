PONY
closing my eyes
I'm getting high
again and again
step out the line
float in the air
I'm getting tired
to follow the world
I've been tried
like the stupid sun ,I shine
like a foolish man ,I write
like a human being ,I lie
like a placid lake ,I'm dried

I've been in love
I used to laugh
with the laughter
now they're far
I met a girl
I opend the jar
I want to restart but it's so hard
like a child to ask you why
like a friend to say I'm fine
like a cat I keep being quiet
like a dream of urs I die.

Look back on all the way
everything was a waste
everyone was mistake

what if we skip the tale
what if we get there straight
that'll really make my day

I've been in love
