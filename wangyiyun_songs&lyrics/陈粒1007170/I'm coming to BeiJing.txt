I'm coming to BeiJing
If someone needs me can't live without Lily
If something needs me I'll bring some fantacy
If someone feeds me love,dream,trust to breathe
I guess I will never leave from Beijing.
gether people dance and sing
we are one big family
yep day day back solo word
don't trouble anymore
I'll meet a girl whose taste is strong
whose whole is all I want
the worst part of me has not gone
hope I won't let you down
sorry there is nothing special I can bring
只能不肉麻地唱出我的心
