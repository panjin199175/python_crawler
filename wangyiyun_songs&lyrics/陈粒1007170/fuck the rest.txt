fuck the rest
I got a plan I'll got u become me
because oneself is who she loves most
There is no need for us to talk that much
but I'm so scared oneday you no longer laugh
It was cold I wore not enough left my ankle bare
you squated dowm touched me to make sure if I'm ok
How could you dare not look straight in my eyes
oh dear
you failed to conceal it when we had sex
stay with me
fuck the rest
stay with me
fuck the rest
till I live
It took no more than 24 hours from I fell in love to I said it
I know it's too impetuous of doing that
but it's the first time I meet a soulmate
It was cold I wore not enough left my ankle bare
you squated dowm touched me to make sure if I'm ok
How could you dare not look straight in my eyes
oh dear
you failed to conceal it when we had sex
stay with me
fuck the rest
stay with me
fuck the rest
stay with me
fuck the rest
stay with me
fuck the rest
till i live
